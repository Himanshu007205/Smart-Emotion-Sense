# Data Directory

This folder is intended to store raw and processed data used in the
Smart Emotion and Stress Monitoring System.

## Contents (Not Included)
- Physiological sensor data (e.g., HRV from ESP8266)
- Facial landmark and video-derived features
- Intermediate processed datasets used for analysis and visualization

## Why data is not included
Actual datasets are excluded from this repository due to:
- Privacy and ethical concerns related to emotion and stress data
- Large file sizes not suitable for version control
- Project portability and reproducibility best practices

## How to generate data
Data can be generated by:
1. Running the IoT firmware to collect physiological signals
2. Using the video capture and analysis scripts in the `src/` directory
3. Storing the generated outputs locally in this folder

Refer to the main project README for the full data generation pipeline.
